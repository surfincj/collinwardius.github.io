Hi! I'm a fourth year PhD student in economics at UC San Diego. I mostly think about topics in education.

<div style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; display: inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
<img src="/images/biking.png" alt="Biking in San Diego" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
<p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; text-align: left;">I like biking so San Diego was a good place to end up for a little while.</p>
</div>
